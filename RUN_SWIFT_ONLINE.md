# 🌐 Running Swift Code Online

## 🎯 Options to Run Swift Without Xcode

While GitHub Pages can't execute Swift directly, here are ways to run your code online:

---

## 1. 🟢 Online Swift Playgrounds (BEST)

### Swift Fiddle

func twoSum(_ nums: [Int], _ target: Int) -> [Int] {
    var map: [Int: Int] = [:]
    for (i, num) in nums.enumerated() {
        if let j = map[target - num] {
            return [j, i]
        }
        map[num] = i
    }
    return []
}

// Test it
print(twoSum([2,7,11,15], 9)) // Output: [0, 1]
