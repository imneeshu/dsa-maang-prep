## 💡 Pro Tips

### 📝 For Each Problem:
1. **Understand first** - Don't rush to code
2. **Multiple approaches** - Try brute force, then optimize
3. **Time yourself** - This builds speed
4. **Review solutions** - Even if you solved it
5. **Revisit** - Re-solve after 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks

### 🎯 Pattern Recognition:
When you see a problem, ask:
- Is this about subarrays? → Sliding Window
- Pairs with target sum? → Two Pointers or Hash Map
- Tree traversal? → DFS or BFS
- Path in graph? → BFS for shortest, DFS for any
- Optimization/counting? → Dynamic Programming
- All combinations? → Backtracking
- Range queries? → Segment Tree or Fenwick Tree

### 🚀 Speed Building:
Week 1-4: Don't worry about time  
Week 5-8: Start timing yourself  
Week 9-12: Strict time limits  

### 🧠 Mental Models:
- Draw pictures for every problem
- Talk through your approach (out loud!)
- Test with small examples first
- Always check edge cases

---

## 🎨 Code Quality Matters

In interviews, write code like this:

```swift
// ✅ GOOD - Clear, commented, handles edge cases
func twoSum(_ nums: [Int], _ target: Int) -> [Int] {
    // Edge case: empty or single element
    guard nums.count > 1 else { return [] }
    
    // Use hash map for O(n) solution
    var map: [Int: Int] = [:]
    
    for (index, num) in nums.enumerated() {
        let complement = target - num
        
        if let complementIndex = map[complement] {
            return [complementIndex, index]
        }
        
        map[num] = index
    }
    
    return []
}

// ❌ BAD - No edge cases, unclear
func twoSum(_ n: [Int], _ t: Int) -> [Int] {
    var m: [Int: Int] = [:]
    for (i, v) in n.enumerated() {
        if let j = m[t-v] { return [j, i] }
        m[v] = i
    }
    return []
}
```

## 📞 When You Feel Stuck

### If a problem seems impossible:
1. Take 5-minute break
2. Read problem again carefully
3. Try simplest examples
4. Look at hints in comments
5. Study one approach, then re-solve

### If you're not making progress:
1. Review your tracker
2. Identify patterns you're weak in
3. Do 5 more problems on that pattern
4. Take a day off (seriously!)
5. Come back fresh

### If you're losing motivation:
1. Remember your goal
2. Look at your progress (you've come far!)
3. Join study group or forum
4. Watch success stories
5. Reward yourself for milestones
