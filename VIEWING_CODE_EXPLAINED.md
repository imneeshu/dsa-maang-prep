## 🌐 Browser Behavior Explained

### **Markdown Files (.md)** → Always Display

```
✅ index.md → Displays as homepage
✅ README.md → Displays formatted
✅ problems/leetcode-top-150.md → Displays perfectly
✅ START_HERE.md → Displays as guide
```

**These NEVER download - they always display in browser!**

### **Swift Files (.swift)** → Usually Display, Sometimes Download

```
Desktop Browsers (Chrome/Safari/Firefox):
  - Usually: Display with syntax highlighting
  - Sometimes: Offer to download
  - Depends on: Browser settings

Mobile Browsers (Safari/Chrome):
  - Often: Download automatically
  - Why: Mobile browsers prefer apps
  - Solution: Use web pages instead!
```

---

## 💡 Recommended Setup

### **For Mobile Study (Phone/Tablet):**

```
Use: Web Pages (.md files)

Example:
  ❌ Don't click: LEETCODE_TOP_150_ANNOTATED.swift
  ✅ Instead click: problems/leetcode-top-150

Why: Web pages display perfectly, never download
```

### **For Coding (Mac/Desktop):**

```
Use: Swift Files (.swift)

Example:
  1. Download: LEETCODE_TOP_150_ANNOTATED.swift
  2. Open: In Xcode
  3. Run: And test

Why: Need actual Swift files for Xcode
```
